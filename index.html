<h2 id=intro>Intro</h2>
<p>
   A healthy alternative to mashed potatoe. Basically, replace potatoes with califlower & mash it up!
</p>


<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Medium-sized head of cauliflower, chopped into florets (about 1 1/2 lbs.)</li>
    <li>4 roasted garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh chives, chopped</li>
    <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>


<h2 id="instruction">Instruction</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Fill a large saucepan with about an inch of water, and insert a steamer basket. Bring the water to a boil, and add the cauliflower florets.</li>
  <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover, allowing the cauliflower to steam for 6-8 minutes, or until fork tender.</li>
  <li>Drain the steamed cauliflower, and transfer to the bowl of a large food processor. Add in the seasonings, and process to your desired texture.</li>
  <li>If additional liquid is needed to facilitate blending, feel free to add a splash of almond milk or water, and adjust the seasonings to your taste.</li>
  <li>I ended up using about a teaspoon of fine sea salt for this particular batch, but each batch may vary, so be sure to start with less than you think you need, and add more as you go.</li>
  <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
